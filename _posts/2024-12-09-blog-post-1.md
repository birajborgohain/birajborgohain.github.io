'As Fabio Crameri, a geoscientist and graphic designer articulates on his webpage --'

" Good science is patiently and carefully crafted, objective, and most of all, accessible. Good science is also making and acknowledging mistakes. I believe, therefore, that good science needs a fair, supportive and, instead of a competitive, a collaborative academic work environment that values all researchers. Academic teams should be primarily diverse, instead of solely high h-indexed, to keep expanding our knowledge and understanding. 

I also think that methodological skills like scientific writing, where uncertainties are more important than a catchy story, scientific visualisation, where actual data is more significant than the author's interpretation, and scientific outreach, where simplicity achieves more than intelligently sounding complexity, are all part of the craft and must – under all circumstances – be valued.
