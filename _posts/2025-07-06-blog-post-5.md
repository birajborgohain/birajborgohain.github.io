“*It's like we've forgotten who we are: explorers, pioneers... not caretakers.*” ― Christopher Nolan (Interstellar)


The phrase "We've forgotten who we are: explorers, pioneers... not caretakers" reflects a profound shift in how humanity views its role in the world. Historically, humans have been driven by a spirit of exploration and discovery, venturing into the unknown, pushing boundaries, and pioneering new frontiers. This identity as explorers and pioneers embodies courage, curiosity, and the relentless pursuit of knowledge and progress. However, in recent times, there is a sense that this adventurous spirit has been overshadowed by a more cautious and protective role that of caretakers. While caretaking implies responsibility, preservation, and stewardship, it can also suggest restraint and a fear of change or risk. The statement challenges us to remember our original essence as bold innovators and boundary-breakers, urging a rekindling of that pioneering mindset to inspire action, innovation, and progress. It suggests that while caring for the environment and society is crucial, it should not come at the cost of losing the dynamic, creative spirit that has driven human advancement throughout history. Balancing these roles—being both explorers and caretakers—might be the key to a future where progress and preservation coexist harmoniously.
