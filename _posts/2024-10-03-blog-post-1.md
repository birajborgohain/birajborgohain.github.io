'*Don’t believe what your eyes are telling you. All they show is limitation. Look with your understanding. Find out what you already know and you will see the way to fly*'. - Bach, R. (1970). *Jonathan Livingston Seagull*. Macmillan.

- This quote transcends the physical world and limitations, it is from a book *Jonathan Livingston Seagull*, encouraging readers to trust their inner potential and imagination. It speaks to the power of intuition and self-belief, which are central themes not only in Jonathan’s journey but in real-life pursuits of personal and professional growth.
- The idea that the external world presents limitations, but true understanding comes from within, is an inspiring message for anyone striving to break barriers and achieve something extraordinary.
