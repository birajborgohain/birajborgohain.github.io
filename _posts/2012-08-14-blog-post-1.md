'When To Do What You Love' is an essay by Paul Graham, that emphasizes the importance of finding work that aligns with your passions rather than chasing prestige or money. 


- To do great work, you need to genuinely love what you do, regardless of its status. And the root of great work is a sort of ambitious curiosity.
- Graham notes that discovering what you love and making a living from it is difficult. It requires discipline, patience, and a willingness to produce, even in the face of obstacles or failures.
