*When to Do What You Love* is an essay by Paul Graham. 
- The essay emphasizes the importance of finding work that aligns with your passions rather than chasing prestige or money.
- To do great work, you need to genuinely love what you do, regardless of its status.
- Graham notes that discovering what you love and making a living from it is difficult. It requires discipline, patience, and a willingness to produce, even in the face of obstacles or failures.
