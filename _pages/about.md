**Researcher** (Earth Sciences lab) at **Prayoga Insititute of Education Research**, Bengaluru

My deep interest lies in integrating geosciences --- mineralogy, geo-thermo-chronology, tectonics, biogeochemistry, and geomicrobiology --- to study the impact of climate change on water and food for a sustainable future. As a geoscientist, the scientific tools that fascinate me most include geo-thermochronometric dating, luminescence dating, geomorphometric analysis, physics-informed machine learning, Bayesian deep learning and reactive transport modeling. These tools can provide data about erosion and weathering patterns, regolith formation, and biogeochemical cycling from soil, water, sediment and rock samples. Integrating these data can help in understanding how natural processes and humans shape Earth's surface in making our Earth habitable, and this, in turn, can enable better management of Earth's resources effectively and efficiently.
