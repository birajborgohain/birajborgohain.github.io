# Climate-Tectonic Interaction
* PhD training developed my interest in investigating the interactions between climate and tectonic processes that impact the habitability and sustainability of life.
* Tools used in quantifying climate-tectonic interplay include (1) geochronology, such as low-temperature thermochronology and optically stimulated luminescence dating; (2) remote sensing data; (3) multidisciplinary sedimentology, tectonics, and geomorphology approach; and (4) Bayesian statistical modeling.
* Field expeditions include Arunachal Pradesh Himalaya (specifically in the Siang, Dibang, and Lohit river valleys), the Shillong plateau, and the Belt of Schuppen (especially in the southeastern boundary of Assam valley and the western part of Nagaland).

# Computer programming to build tools for the geoscience community

* Developing skills to write code in Python, C++, and FORTRAN.
* Exploring physics-informed machine learning (PIML) methods to enable effective modeling of complex Earth systems involving multiple physical processes, scale lengths, and phases. PIML is an approach that incorporates deep learning with fundamental physical laws aiming to develop physics-consistent and scalable machine learning models to facilitate new discoveries from scientific data.   

# Mineral-Microbe-Water Interaction 

* Post-doctoral journey developed my interest in mineral-microbe-water interaction. Now exploring (1) how minerals form and react with their surrounding solutions - atomic to pore scale geochemical processes, (2) biogeochemical transformation and transportation of chemical and biological components at different temporal and spatial scales, (3) modeling ecological and biogeochemical impacts of mineral-microbe-water interactions based geoengineering methods.
  
# Earth Science Education Research

* My science education research involves designing research projects and conducting fieldwork for school students as a means to popularise geoscience and prepare them for careers in Earth Sciences.
