# Computer programming to build tools for the geoscience community (2024-Present)

* Developing coding skills in Python, C++, and FORTRAN.
* Exploring physics-informed machine learning (PIML) methods for modeling complex Earth systems involving multiple physical processes, scales, and phases. PIML combines deep learning with fundamental physical laws, aiming to create physics-consistent and scalable models that facilitate scientific discoveries from data.

# Mineral-Microbe-Water Interaction (2024-present)

* Exploring (a) how minerals react with surrounding solutionsâ€”focusing on atomic to pore-scale geochemical processes for understanding soil-carbon dynamic, (b) the biogeochemical transformation of minerals and transport of chemical components across different spatial and temporal scales to study environmental contamination, and (c) models of ecological and biogeochemical systems that assess the impacts of mineral-microbe-water interactions in geoengineering methods such as Enhanced Rock Weathering.

# Earth Science Education Research (2023-Present)

* Guiding young researchers (high school students) in their research projects and fieldwork to popularize geoscience and prepare them for careers in Earth Sciences.
  
# Bayesian Machine Learning (2020-Present)

* Applied Bayesian Machine Learning (BML) for inverting detrital cooling ages into erosion history using the PyMC Python library.

* Bayesian Machine Learning is an approach in artificial intelligence that seamlessly integrates statistical inference with machine learning. Unlike traditional machine learning, which primarily emphasizes predictions, BML incorporates the principles of probability and inference, creating a framework where learning dynamically evolves as new evidence is acquired.
   
# Climate-Tectonic Interaction (2014-Present)
* Studied the interactions between climate and tectonic processes associated with the Himalayan orogeny.
* Tools used in quantifying climate-tectonic interplay include (1) geochronology, such as low-temperature thermochronology and optically stimulated luminescence dating; (2) remote sensing data; (3) multidisciplinary sedimentology, tectonics, and geomorphology approach; and (4) Bayesian statistical modeling.
* Field expeditions include Arunachal Pradesh Himalaya (specifically in the Siang, Dibang, and Lohit river valleys), the Shillong plateau, and the Belt of Schuppen (especially in the southeastern boundary of Assam valley and the western part of Nagaland).
